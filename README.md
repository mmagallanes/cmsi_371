### [Cartoonify](https://github.com/mmagallanes/cmsi_371/tree/master/assignment1)

Using C++ in XCode, we were to take a photo of a person and recreate it to the best of our ability using Bezier curves. 

### [Geometric Modeling of a Scene](https://github.com/mmagallanes/cmsi_371/tree/master/assignment2_v2)

Using C++ in XCode, we were assigned to form a cube using 6 planes, by rotating and/or translating from a base plane. 

### [Shading via Lighting and Colors](https://github.com/mmagallanes/cmsi_371/tree/master/assignment3_v2)

Using C++ in XCode, we were assigned to re-create a scene, with adjusted lighting and colored 3D models. 

I recreated the bedroom (bed, bench at the foot of the bed, table, and monolith) from the film, *2001: A Space Odyssey* with the lighting instead of coming primarily from the floor, coming from the side.
