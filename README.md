### Computer Graphics: Spring 2018



##### <u>Assignment 1: Cartoonify</u>

Using C++ in XCode, we were to take a photo of a person and recreate it to the best of our ability using Bezier curves. 

##### <u>Assignment 2: Geometric Modeling of a Scene</u>

Using C++ in XCode, we were assigned to form a cube using 6 planes, by rotating and/or translating from a base plane. 

On the first submission of the assignment (**Original Assignment 2**), I was unable to fully form a cube. 

On the second submission of the assignment, I figured out my mistake and now have a fully formed cube in **Resubmission of Assignment 2**. 

##### <u>Assignment 3: Shading via Lighting and Colors</u>

Using C++ in XCode, we were assigned to re-create a scene, with adjusted lighting and colored 3D models. 

On the first submission of the assignment (**Original Assignment 3**), I was only able to figure out how to make a fully formed cube, built off of assignment 2, and several colors to it. 

On the second submission of the assignment (**Resubmission of Assignment 3**), I recreated the bedroom (bed, bench at the foot of the bed, table, and monolith) from the film, *2001: A Space Odyssey* with the lighting instead of coming primarily from the floor, coming from the side.
