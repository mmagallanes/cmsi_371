# cmsi_371: Computer Graphics - Spring 2018

### [Assignment 1: Cartoonify](https://github.com/mmagallanes/cmsi_371/tree/master/assignment1)

> Using C++ in XCode, we were to take a photo of a person and recreate it to the best of our ability using Bezier curves. 

### Assignment 2: Geometric Modeling of a Scene

> Using C++ in XCode, we were assigned to form a cube using 6 planes, by rotating and/or translating from a base plane. 

- [Original Assignment 2](https://github.com/mmagallanes/cmsi_371/tree/master/Original%20Assignment%202)
> On the first submission of the assignment, I was unable to fully form a cube. 

- [Resubmission of Assignment 2]()
> On the second submission of the assignment, I figured out my mistake in the matrix multiplication function, and now have a fully formed cube.

### Assignment 3: Shading via Lighting and Colors

> Using C++ in XCode, we were assigned to re-create a scene, with adjusted lighting and colored 3D models. 

- [Original Assignment 3](https://github.com/mmagallanes/cmsi_371/tree/master/Original%20Assignment%203)
> On the first submission of the assignment, I was only able to figure out how to make a fully formed cube, built off of assignment 2, and several colors to it. 

- [Resubmission of Assignment 3](https://github.com/mmagallanes/cmsi_371/tree/master/Resubmission%20of%20Assignment%203)
> On the second submission of the assignment, I recreated the bedroom (bed, bench at the foot of the bed, table, and monolith) from the film, *2001: A Space Odyssey* with the lighting instead of coming primarily from the floor, coming from the side.
